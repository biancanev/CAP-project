#### How to use HTML
HTML is organized in what is called *tags*. For example, to use the *p* tag, type *<p>* to start. Likewise if you want to use the *div* tab, 
you would type *<div>*
#### HTML attributes
Some HTML tags do not cover all the information needed for the computer to create the desired output, therefore you would add an attribute 
to the HTML tag. Standard Sytax is this:
```html
<tag attribute="value">Input</tag>
```
Common tags are:
  *class
  *id
  *title
